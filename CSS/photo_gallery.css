Flexbox has a main and cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, which has four possible values:

row (default): horizontal axis with flex items from left to right
row-reverse: horizontal axis with flex items from right to left
column: vertical axis with flex items from top to bottom
column-reverse: vertical axis with flex items from bottom to top
Note: The axes and directions will be different depending on the text direction. The values shown are for a left-to-right text direction.

The flex-wrap property determines how your flex items behave when the flex container is too small. 
Setting it to wrap will allow the items to wrap to the next row or column. 
nowrap (default) will prevent your items from wrapping and shrink them if needed.

The justify-content property determines how the items inside a flex container are positioned along the main axis, affecting their position and the space around them.

The align-items property positions the flex content along the cross axis. 
In this case, with your flex-direction set to row, your cross axis would be vertical.

Notice how some of your images have become distorted. 
This is because the images have different aspect ratios. 
Rather than setting each aspect ratio individually, you can use the object-fit property to determine how images should behave.
Give your .gallery img selector the object-fit property and set it to cover. 
This will tell the image to fill the img container while maintaining aspect ratio, resulting in cropping to fit.

Your images need some space between them.
The gap CSS shorthand property sets the gaps, also knowns as gutters, between rows and columns. 
The gap property and its row-gap and column-gap sub-properties provide this functionality for flex, grid, and multi-column layout. 
You apply the property to the container element

The ::after pseudo-element creates an element that is the last child of the selected element. 
You can use it to add an empty element after the last image. 
If you give it the same width as the images it will push the last image to the left when the gallery is in a two-column layout. 
Right now, it is in the center because you set justify-content: center on the flex container.
Example:
.container::after {
  content: "";
  width: 860px;
}
