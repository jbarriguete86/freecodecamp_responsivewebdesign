    To create chartreuse green, update the rgb function in the .one rule so that red is at 127, and set green to the max value.

    For azure, update the rgb function in the .two rule so that green is at 127 and blue is at the max value.

    And for rose, which is sometimes called bright pink, update the rgb function in the .three rule so that blue is at 127 and red is at the max
    
    A color wheel is a circle where similar colors, or hues, are near each other, and different ones are further apart. For example, pure red is between the hues rose and orange.

    Two colors that are opposite from each other on the color wheel are called complementary colors. If two complementary colors are combined, they produce gray. 

    But when they are placed side-by-side, these colors produce strong visual contrast and appear brighter.
    
    Notice that the red and cyan colors are very bright right next to each other. This contrast can be distracting if it's overused on a website, 
    
    and can make text hard to read if it's placed on a complementary-colored background.

    It's better practice to choose one color as the dominant color, and use its complementary color 
    
    as an accent to bring attention to certain content on the page.
    
    Notice how your eyes are naturally drawn to the red color in the center? 
    
    When designing a site, you can use this effect to draw attention to important headings, buttons, or links.

    Hex color values start with a # character and take six characters from 0-9 and A-F. 
    
    The first pair of characters represent red, the second pair represent green, and the third pair represent blue. 

    The HSL color model, or hue, saturation, and lightness, is another way to represent colors.

    The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for hue, a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation, and a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.

    If you imagine a color wheel, the hue red is at 0 degrees, green is at 120 degrees, and blue is at 240 degrees.

    Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color.

    Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, to 100%, complete white, with 50% being neutral.
    
    A gradient is when one color transitions into another. The CSS linear-gradient function lets you control the direction of the transition along a line, 
    
    and which colors are used.

    One thing to remember is that the linear-gradient function actually creates an image element, 

    and is usually paired with the background property which can accept an image as a value.

    olor-stops allow you to fine-tune where colors are placed along the gradient line. 
    
    They are a length unit like px or percentages that follow a color in the linear-gradient function.

    For example, in this red-black gradient, the transition from red to black takes place at the 90% point along the gradient line, 

    so red takes up most of the available space: linear-gradient(90deg, red 90%, black);

    If no gradientDirection argument is provided to the linear-gradient function, it arranges colors from top to bottom, or along a 180 degree line, by default.
